If you like well formatted files use this plugin to chage the indention of a complete file.

Annotations:
The indention information is taken out of the VIM Indent-files. This
script processes them in a little different way than vim itself, therefore
it is possible that the indent-functions have to be rewritten before they 
work.
This script tries to rewrite the indent functions automatically (during 
this a file "reindent.tmp" will be created in your current working 
directory).
There may be indent functions out there that don't work with this script  because they are too complex to be rewriten automatically with my 
code.
                                                                                
Preconditions:
- A indent function has to exist for your current file (indentexpr is set)
- Your current working directory has to be writable if Indent-function has to be rewritten.

Usage:
1. Copy this file to your plugin directory
2. start vim with i.E. a HTML-File
3. Hit <Lead>R (If you don't know what <Leader> is read :help leader 
    or press \R to reindent).
    If using menus you will find a new menu item "Reindent" in menu 
    "Syntax".
4. Customize the Keystroke with an Entry in your .vimrc i.E.:
    map ff <Plug>reindent " call reindent by pressing ff
